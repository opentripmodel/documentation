Simacan initiated the development of the open standard OpenTripModel (OTM) several years ago. In this article, Bart Kummel -cofounder of OTM- explains why this was such an important step and why OTM will play an important role in further optimizing and automating logistics processes. He also explains why he thinks weâ€™ll see more and more parties implementing OTM in their product in the near future.
