To validate messages against the Open Trip Model (OTM), users can utilize the Validator Tool available in the [Semantic Treehouse (STH)](https://www.semantic-treehouse.nl/). This tool allows users to input or upload their message instances and run validation tests to check for compliance with OTM standards. After running a test, the Validator generates a report detailing any violations or inconsistencies found in the message, along with guidance on how these issues deviate from OTM standards. With this feedback, messages can be refined to comply with these standards.

How does it work?

The checkboxes of the active business rule sets are ticked by default. Users can check or uncheck boxes themselves based on their validation preference.

    2. **Syntax erors:** Syntax errors result in a parse error and immediately end the validation process, skipping the schema and business rules validation steps.
