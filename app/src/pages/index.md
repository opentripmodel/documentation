# Open Trip Model

What is the Open Trip Model?
------------
The Open Trip Model (OTM) is an open-source, lightweight data specification designed to simplify communication across logistics and traffic networks. Created by Simacan, OTM facilitates the real-time exchange of logistic trip data on the web, enabling seamless collaboration among shippers, carriers, software vendors, OEMs, and truck manufacturers. The model addresses the inefficiencies caused by diverse data formats in the logistics sector, which often create complex and costly custom translation layers between companies. By standardizing data exchange, OTM makes the technological landscape simpler and more cost-effective, encouraging innovation and collaboration within the industry.

Open Trip Model’s Development and Industry Role
------------

Since its introduction, OTM has been implemented by a wide range of logistics service providers, shippers, and IT suppliers across various use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications. Originally developed with funding from the Dutch government’s Beter Benutten program, OTM aimed to improve accessibility to the nation’s transport infrastructure by promoting collaboration among businesses, regions, and government authorities. In 2018, Simacan transferred stewardship of OTM to Stichting Uniforme Transport Code (SUTC), which collaborates with key stakeholders, including Transport en Logistiek Nederland (TLN), evofenedex, and the Dutch Association of Transport and IT suppliers (DALTI).

OTM’s success is evident through its adoption by over 20 transport carriers, who utilize it to streamline data sharing with large-scale shippers, retailers, and public road authorities in the Netherlands. The specifications support communication about planned, ongoing, and completed trips, enabling logistics actors and road authorities to coordinate routes and operations in real time.

Open Trip Model and Community Involvement
--------
Recognizing that no two logistic operations are identical, OTM’s open structure allows users to adopt, modify, and extend the model to fit their specific operational needs. Participants are encouraged to contribute feedback, suggest new features, and join the OpenTripModel Forum—a collaborative network of industry experts committed to refining and promoting OTM.
