# Open Trip Model



The what and why of Open Trip Model
------------

After years of working in the domain of logistics and traffic data we have experienced that various parties represent the same type of data differently. This is not unexpected, since every party optimizes for their own use case, but has as a result that custom translation layers need to be made over and over again when these parties want to communicate with each other. This is a costly and time consuming experience. When parties that use the same type of data actually use the same language, you don't have to make these translations layers anymore. This makes the technological landscape simpler and results in less custom-made software.

Instead, it is better to invest in this specification once, with a one-time cost of implementation and specification, creating a better understanding between various parties.

Note that OTM is not aiming to remove all custom-made software within the domain, it is aiming to greatly reduce the amount of custom-made software. OTM is in active development and will continously be able to support more use cases and provide more guidelines on how to model these use cases correctly.
