# Open Trip Model

What is the Open Trip Model?
------------
In this day and age more and more information about logistics and traffic is shared over the Internet between various parties. To make this communication easier the Open Trip Model specification was created. It is a lightweight data model used to exchange real-time logistic trip data on the web, and to make it easier for shippers, carriers, software vendors, OEMs, and truck manufacturers to create new multi-brand application and services

OpenTripModel is a simple, free, lightweight and easy-to-use data model, used to exchange real-time logistic trip data on the web, and making it easier for shippers, carriers, software vendors, OEMs, and truck manufacturers to create new multi-brand application and services.

OpenTripModel is currently used and implemented by multiple logistics service providers, shippers and IT suppliers for different use cases.
The OpenTripModel is initiated and developed by Simacan In order to speed up innovation in the market, Simacan decided to open up the OpenTripModel specification for everyone to use, modify, and enrich. Ultimately, this will make it cheaper and easier for everyone in the logistics sector to exchange data, and develop and use new applications and services.

Therefore Simacan handed over the Open Trip Model to SUTC - Stichting Uniforme Transport code in 2018 for further development, implementation and adoption. SUTC acts on behalf of Transport en Logistiek Nederland and evofenedex and works in close cooperation with DALTI. SUTC is an expertise centre for Logistics IT standard and develops and maintains the Open Trip Model for and together with logistics service providers, shippers and IT suppliers.

The what and why of Open Trip Model
------------

After years of working in the domain of logistics and traffic data we have experienced that various parties represent the same type of data differently. This is not unexpected, since every party optimizes for their own use case, but has as a result that custom translation layers need to be made over and over again when these parties want to communicate with each other. This is a costly and time consuming experience. When parties that use the same type of data actually use the same language, you don't have to make these translations layers anymore. This makes the technological landscape simpler and results in less custom-made software.

Instead, it is better to invest in this specification once, with a one-time cost of implementation and specification, creating a better understanding between various parties.

Note that OTM is not aiming to remove all custom-made software within the domain, it is aiming to greatly reduce the amount of custom-made software. OTM is in active development and will continously be able to support more use cases and provide more guidelines on how to model these use cases correctly.

Logistics is cooperation
--------
The logistics sector is a network where multiple parties work together as a chain. Being able to communicate about trips is a necessity, especially when several actors are involved. This why the logistics sector can incredibly benefit from an open standard which is also truly cooperative in nature.

The benefit of a common interface for sharing data is established. Right after its creation, OpenTripModel has immediately proven its effectiveness in the logistics practice. OpenTripModel has been used by several actors involved in the same logistic operation to communicate with each other about planned, ongoing, and realized trips and between logistic actors and road authorities to communicate about routes.

The OpenTripModel specification found on this website will facilitate you in adopting and further developing the OpenTripModel open standard. Now you may also join the OpenTripModel initiative and have access to its open data model!

As of today, adopting the OpenTripModel means joining an open standard that already interfaces with 3 large-scale shippers, about 20 transport carriers within the Netherlands and local administrations in the role of road authority.

The creation of an open standard
--------
The need for an agreed communication standard between shippers and carriers led to the open-sourced specification called OpenTripModel. OpenTripModel has been initiated and developed by Simacan with the financial contribution of Beter Benutten. The Dutch government programme Beter Benutten has decided to invest in OpenTripModel, as they believe that OpenTripModel can underpin their goal to improve road, waterway and railway accessibility in the busiest regions, by stimulating businesses to work together with regions and government.

In 2018 the Open Trip Model was handed over by Simacan to SUTC - Stichting Uniforme Transport Code â€“ an expertise centrum for Logististics IT standards. SUTC The board of SUTC consists out of Transport en Logistiek Nederland (TLN), evofenedex en NBB. SUTC works closely together with DALTI. The Dutch Association of Transport and IT suppliers. DALTI

The goals of SUTC is to facilitate the logistics industry to exchange of data on a safe and efficient according the principles of open IT standards.
Open Standards" are standards made available to the general public and are developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. "Open Standards" facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption

OpenTripModel is currently implemented within Simacan Control Tower and is being used by over 20 carriers providing transport services to the largest retailer in the Netherlands as well as the Dutch postal service provider. OpenTripModel has been in production since 2014.

Future development
--------
No two logistic operations are the same. Each and every actor within the logistics sector has its own specific processes. Opening OpenTripModel to the public gives you the chance to adopt, modify, and extend OpenTripModel to fit the needs of your own operation.

You can give feedback and propose new features which you see appropriate in the development of OpenTripModel specification, through this website. You can also browse the OpenTripModel FAQ.

The developments envisioned for OpenTripModel include adding the modeling of different types of trip activities (e.g. planned waiting times, planned breaks, or other activities) and giving both logistics actors and road authorities a way of communicating about preferred and alternative routes. Thus, actually facilitating last mile truck guidance by combining public and private data.

The final goal of our initiative is elevating OpenTripModel to the status of reference open source standard for the execution of logistic operations. Part of this goal is the creation of an OpenTripModel Forum, a community of experts and industry leaders who together will share the responsibilities for further developing OpenTripModel and boosting its adoption.
