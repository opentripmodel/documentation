Fleet Management Systems
================================

Overview
--------

Within transport processes start with defining _consignments_ that need to be
delivered, which are eventually _planned_ into trips. At some point the vehicle
carrying the goods actually starts driving. Usually, some device (either the
vehicle itself, or some separate device placed in the vehicle) will start
emitting GPS updates of the current location at that point in time. To model
this OTM5 contains the `LocationUpdateEvent` that contains this GPS update and
the time of measuring. This is captured in the _fleet management systems_
profile, also known as FMS profile.

Currently the scope of this profile _only_ contains the GPS updates, but it will
also incorporate other sensor data (such as temperature, road situtations,
traffic jams, etc.) later once we have a more solid grip on how to model it in
OTM.

One available implementation of this profile is the **[FMS ITS](fms_its_implementation.md)**.

General structure
-----------------

The shape of messages in this profile is very simple, it contains the single
event type `LocationUpdateEvent` with the GPS coordinates, and optional speed
and heading information:

```json
{
  "creationDate": "2022-06-10T12:43:00.46Z",
  "lifecycle": "actual",
  "vehicle": {
    "uuid": "1ee62c47-5c2a-4681-b209-b1bfa15bc1bb",
    "entityType": "vehicle",
    "associationType": "reference"
  },
  "geoReference": {
    "lat": 51.95179,
    "lon": 4.57067,
    "speed": {
      "value": 82,
      "unit": "kmh"
    },
    "heading": {
      "value": 38,
      "unit": "degrees"
    },
    "type": "latLonPointGeoReference"
  }
}
```

There are a few rules to this profile:
* Since this event is happening in real-time, the required lifecycle is
  `actual`.
* The vehicle that emits the event is usually referenced to keep messages small
  (there are usually a lot of location updates). Note that it is possible to
  have location updates without a vehicle, for example whenever a phone with
  some tracking app is used. Currently OTM does not allow to attach a vehicle to
  another type of device yet. So, whenever this is the case, it is recommended
  to use the external attributes to refer to the device identifier emitting the
  event instead of a vehicle.
* The geoReference is mandatory and **always** required to be a
  `latLonPointGeoReference`.
* Optionally, actors are also allowed, to indicate whom the event belongs to.
  This is especially helpful with cross shipper/carrier operations.

Protobuf
--------

Since these type of messages can occur a lot and need to be processed as soon as
possible we recognize the need to for something smaller than JSON messages, such
as binary formats. Protobuf is one of the available formats and OTM5 supports
the use of Protobuf instead of JSON for `LocationUpdateEvent`s. Protobuf was
developed by Google and made available as open source.

Google's own [page](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) uses the
following definition

> “Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible
> mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster,
> and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you
> can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
> data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages”.

As a next step we will create an official `LocationUpdateEvent` Protobuf schema
and make it available here.

Profobuf is also used in the **[FMS ITS](fms_its_profile.md)**.
